# *The 23rd Channel*
The TV set is my shepherd. My spiritual growth shall want.
It makes me to sit down and do nothing for His name’s sake, because it requireth all my spare time. It keepeth me from doing my duty as a Christian because it presenteth so many shows that I must see.
It restoreth my knowledge of the things of the world, and keepeth me from the study of God’s Word. It leadeth me in paths of failing to attend the evening services, and doing nothing in the Kingdom of God.
Yea, though I live to be a hundred, I shall keep on viewing my TV as long as it will work, for it is my closest companion. Its sound and its picture, they comfort me.
It presenteth entertainment before me, and keepeth me from doing important things with my family. It fills my head with ideas which differ from those set forth in the Word of God.
Surely, no good thing will come of my life, because my TV offereth no good time to do the will of God thus I will dwell in the place of the Devil and his angels forever.
