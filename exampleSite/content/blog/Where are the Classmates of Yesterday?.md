# *Where are the Classmates of Yesterday?*
Where are the classmates of yesterday?
The children we knew in school . . .
Oh, what has become of the studious one?
And where oh where is the fool?
Oh, what has become of the orator . . .
Whose passion it was to recite?
And the bashful kid who could speak no piece . . .
Unless he succumbed to fright?
And what has become of the teacher’s pet . . .
Who was always so perfect and right?
And what oh what, of the tough young nut . . .
Who loved nothing more than a fight?
The studious one - - - so we’ve been told . . .
Is driving a cab these days.
While the fool owns stock in a bank or two
And a business that always pays.
The orator works in a grocery store . . .
Selling tea and rubber bands.
While the bashful kid is a Senator . . .
Proclaimed throughout all the land.
The teacher’s pet is behind bars . . .
For stealing a neighbor’s cow.
And what of the tough young nut?
Why - - - He’s a Preacher now!
